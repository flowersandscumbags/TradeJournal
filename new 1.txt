In coding best practices, fixing syntax errors should always be done with functionality in mind. The goal should be to:

Resolve the error so that the program runs.
Ensure that the functionality remains intact or is improved.
If a part of the code is not functional (like placeholder logic), it should still be handled in a way that signals intended functionality for future development.
